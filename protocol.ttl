<file:///var/www/specification/protocol.html#introduction> <http://schema.org/description> "\n              The aims of the Solid project are in line with those of the Web itself: empowerment towards an equitable, informed and interconnected society. Solid adds to existing Web standards to realise a space where individuals can maintain their autonomy, control their data and privacy, and choose applications and services to fulfil their needs.\n\n              The Solid ecosystem encapsulates a set of specifications that are guided by the principles we have adopted and also the priority of our values. We acknowledge that every technical decision has ethical implications both for the end user (short-term) as well as society (long-term). To contribute towards a net positive social benefit, we use the Ethical Web Principles to orient ourselves. The consensus on the technical designs are informed by common use cases, implementation experience, and use.\n\n              An overarching design goal of the Solid ecosystem is to be evolvable and to provide fundamental affordances for decentralised Web applications for information exchange in a way that is secure and privacy respecting. In this environment, actors allocate identifiers for their content, shape and store data where they have access to, set access control policies, and use preferred applications and services to achieve them.\n\n              The general architectural principles of Solid specifications are borrowed from the Architecture of the World Wide Web. The components as described in each specification may evolve independently \u2013 according to the principle of orthogonality in order to increase the flexibility and robustness of the Solid ecosystem. With that, the specifications are loosely coupled and indicate which features overlap with those governed by another specification. Extensibility as well as variability also are taken into account in each specification.\n\n              The specifications in the ecosystem describe how Solid servers and clients can be interoperable by using Web communication protocols, global identifiers, authentication and authorization mechanisms, data formats and shapes, and query interfaces.\n\n              The specifications are accompanied with supplemental documents, such as Primers and Best Practices and Guidelines to help implementers to form a well-rounded understanding of the Solid ecosystem as well as ways to improve their implementations.\n\n              This specification is for:\n\n              \n                Resource server developers that want to enable clients to send and retrieve information;\n                Application developers that want to implement a client to perform operations on resources.\n              \n\n              \n                Terminology\n                \n                  This section is non-normative.\n\n                  The Solid Protocol specification defines the following terms.

In future versions of this specification, this design may be revisited.\n                    \n                  \n\n                  \n                    Contained Resource Metadata\n                    \n                      Container descriptions are not limited to containment triples. To further support client navigation and application interaction, servers can include resource metadata about contained resources as part of the container description, as described below.\n\n                      Servers SHOULD include resource metadata about contained resources as part of the container description, unless that information is inapplicable to the server.\n\n                      Contained resource metadata statements include the properties:\n\n                      \n                        rdf:type\n                        A class whose URI is the expansion of the URI Template [RFC6570] http://www.w3.org/ns/iana/media-types/{+iana-media-type}#Resource, where iana-media-type corresponds to a value from the IANA Media Types [IANA-MEDIA-TYPES].\n                        stat:size\n                        A non-negative integer giving the size of the resource in bytes.\n                        dcterms:modified\n                        The date and time when the resource was last modified.\n                        stat:mtime\n                        The Unix time when the resource was last modified.\n                      \n\n                      The dcterms:modified value of a contained resource corresponds with the Last-Modified header value of the contained resource. If one were to perform HEAD or GET requests on the URI of the contained resource at the time of the HTTP message\u2019s generation, then a response with the 200 status code including the Last-Modified header would indicate the same date and time.\n\n                      \n                        Note: Contained Resource Metadata Considerations\n                        \n                          The generation of contained resource metadata may be inapplicable to some servers, for example, when that information does not exist or is expensive to determine.\n                        \n                      \n\n                      Contained resource metadata is protected by the server.\n\n                      [Source]\n                      [Source] [Source]\n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n\n              \n                Auxiliary Resources\n                \n                  Solid has the notion of auxiliary resources to provide supplementary information such as descriptive metadata, authorization conditions, data shape constraints, digital rights or provenance record about a given resource (hereafter referred as the subject resource), and affects how resources and others associated with it are processed, served or interpreted.\n\n                  Server manages the association between a subject resource and auxiliary resources defined by this specification. The lifecycle of auxiliary resources defined by this specification depend on the lifecycle of the subject resource that they are associated with.\n\n                  Auxiliary resources are represented as RDF documents [RDF11-CONCEPTS]. HTTP interactions on auxiliary resources are subject to the requirements as per Reading and Writing Resources.\n\n                  \n                    Note: Self-describing Resources\n                    \n                      Where applicable, to promote self-describing resources, implementations and authors are encouraged to use the subject resource instead of the associated auxiliary resource.\n                    \n                  \n\n                  This specification defines the following types of auxiliary resources:\n\n                  \n                    Web Access Control\n                    Resource Description\n                  \n\n                  Clients can discover auxiliary resources associated with a subject resource by making an HTTP HEAD or GET request on the target URL, and checking the HTTP Link header with the rel parameter [RFC8288].\n\n                  \n                    \n                      \n                        Auxiliary Type\n                        Link Relation\n                        Definitions\n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                        Web Access Control\n                        acl\n                        [WAC]\n                      \n                      \n                        Description Resource\n                        describedby\n                        [LDP]\n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                        \n                          \n                            The possibility of using URIs as relation types interchangeably or as alternate to the tokens above are under consideration:\n\n                            \n                              http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/acl#accessControl\n                              https://www.w3.org/ns/iana/link-relations/relation#acl\n                              https://www.w3.org/ns/iana/link-relations/relation#describedby\n                              https://www.w3.org/ns/iana/link-relations/relation#describes\n                            \n\n                            Issue\n                          \n                        \n                      \n                    \n                  \n\n                  \n                    Web Access Control\n                    \n                      An auxiliary resource of type Web Access Control provides access control description of a subject resource (Web Access Control).\n                    \n                  \n\n                  \n                    Description Resource\n                    \n                      An auxiliary resource of type Description Resource provides a description of a subject resource ([LDP]).\n\n                      Servers MUST NOT directly associate more than one description resource to a subject resource.\n\n                      When an HTTP request targets a description resource, the server MUST apply the authorization rule that is used for the subject resource with which the description resource is associated.\n\n                      Clients can discover resources that are described by description resources by making an HTTP HEAD or GET request on the target URL, and checking the HTTP Link header with a rel value of describes (inverse of the describedby relation) [RFC6892].\n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            "^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> .

[Source]\n                      The resulting variable mapping is propagated to the ?deletions and ?insertions formulae to obtain two sets of resulting triples.\n                      If the set of triples resulting from ?deletions is non-empty and the dataset does not contain all of these triples, the server MUST respond with a 409 status code.

[Source]\n\n                    An N3 Patch is a document in the Notation3 (N3) format [N3], identified by the media type text/n3, conforming to the following constraints:\n\n                    \n                      A patch document MUST contain one or more patch resources.\n                      A patch resource MUST be identified by a URI or blank node, which we refer to as ?patch in the remainder of this section.\n                      A patch resource MAY contain a triple [RDF11-CONCEPTS] ?patch rdf:type solid:Patch.\n                      A patch resource MUST contain at most one triple of the form ?patch solid:deletes ?deletions.\n                      A patch resource MUST contain at most one triple of the form ?patch solid:inserts ?insertions.\n                      A patch resource MUST contain at most one triple of the form ?patch solid:where ?conditions.\n                      When present, ?deletions, ?insertions, and ?conditions MUST be non-nested cited formulae [N3] consisting only of triples and/or triple patterns [SPARQL11-QUERY]. When not present, they are presumed to be the empty formula {}.\n                    \n\n                    While other specifications might provide a structure and interpretation for a wider class of N3 Patch documents, the present specification only governs the application of N3 Patch documents that additionally adhere to the following constraints:\n\n                    \n                      The patch document MUST contain exactly one patch resource, identified by one or more of the triple patterns described above, which all share the same ?patch subject.\n                      A patch resource MUST contain a triple ?patch rdf:type solid:InsertDeletePatch.\n                      The ?insertions and ?deletions formulae MUST NOT contain variables that do not occur in the ?conditions formula.\n                      The ?insertions and ?deletions formulae MUST NOT contain blank nodes.\n                    \n\n                    Servers MUST respond with a 422 status code [RFC4918] if a patch document does not satisfy all of the above constraints.\n\n                    When ?conditions is non-empty, servers MUST treat the request as a Read operation. When ?insertions is non-empty, servers MUST (also) treat the request as an Append operation. When ?deletions is non-empty, servers MUST treat the request as a Read and Write operation.\n\n                    Servers MUST process a patch resource against the target document as follows:\n\n                    \n                      Start from the RDF dataset in the target document, or an empty RDF dataset if the target resource does not exist yet.\n                      If ?conditions is non-empty, find all (possibly empty) variable mappings such that all of the resulting triples occur in the dataset.\n                      If no such mapping exists, or if multiple mappings exist, the server MUST respond with a 409 status code. [Source]\n                      The resulting variable mapping is propagated to the ?deletions and ?insertions formulae to obtain two sets of resulting triples.\n                      If the set of triples resulting from ?deletions is non-empty and the dataset does not contain all of these triples, the server MUST respond with a 409 status code. [Source]\n                      The triples resulting from ?deletions are to be removed from the RDF dataset.\n                      The triples resulting from ?insertions are to be added to the RDF dataset, with each blank node from ?insertions resulting in a newly created blank node.\n                      The combination of deletions followed by insertions then forms the new resource state of the RDF document, and the server responds with the appropriate status code.\n                    \n                  \n\n                  \n                    Example: Applying an N3 patch.\n                    @prefix solid: <http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/terms#>.\n@prefix ex: <http://www.example.org/terms#>.\n\n_:rename a solid:InsertDeletePatch;\n  solid:where   { ?person ex:familyName \"Garcia\". };\n  solid:inserts { ?person ex:givenName \"Alex\". };\n  solid:deletes { ?person ex:givenName \"Claudia\". }.\n                    This N3 Patch instructs to rename Claudia Garcia into Alex Garcia, on the condition that no other Garcia family members are present in the target RDF document.\n                  \n                \n              \n\n              \n                Deleting Resources\n                \n                  Servers MUST support the HTTP DELETE method [RFC7231]. [Source] [Source]\n\n                  When a DELETE request targets storage\u2019s root container or its associated ACL resource, the server MUST respond with the 405 status code. Server MUST exclude the DELETE method in the HTTP response header Allow in response to requests to these resources [RFC7231]. [Source]\n\n                  When a contained resource is deleted, the server MUST also remove the corresponding containment triple. [Source]\n\n                  When a contained resource is deleted, the server MUST also delete the associated auxiliary resources (see the Auxiliary Resources section).\n\n                  When a DELETE request targets a container, the server MUST delete the container if it contains no resources. If the container contains resources, the server MUST respond with the 409 status code and response body describing the error. [Source]\n\n                  This section is non-normative.\n\n                  The server might perform additional actions, as described in the normative references like [RFC7231]. For example, the server could remove membership triples referring to the deleted resource, perform additional cleanup tasks for resources it knows are no longer referenced or have not been accessed for some period of time, and so on.\n\n                  Subsequent GET requests to the deleted resource usually result in a 404 or 410 status code, although HTTP allows others.

[Source] Source] [Source] [Source]\n\n                  When a PUT, POST, PATCH or DELETE method request targets a representation URL that is different than the resource URL, the server MUST respond with a 307 or 308 status code and Location header specifying the preferred URI reference.

<file:///var/www/specification/protocol.html#cors> <http://schema.org/description> "\n              Solid apps typically access data from multiple sources. However, Web browsers by default prevent apps that run on one origin from accessing data on other origins. This cross-origin protection is a security mechanism that ensures malicious websites cannot simply read your profile or banking details from other websites. However, this reasonable default poses a problem even for benevolent Solid apps, which might have good reasons to access data from different places. For instance, a Solid app at https://app.example/ would be prevented from accessing data on https://guinan.example/ or https://darmok.example/, even when Guinan and Darmok have given the user of the app their permission to see some of their data.\n\n              For cases where the other origins have their own access protection mechanism \u2014 like within Solid \u2014 the browser\u2019s built-in cross-origin protection is actually an obstacle rather than a feature. After all, storages already ensure through access control that certain documents can only be accessed by specific people or applications. Preventively blocking apps from different origins thus introduces an unnecessary barrier.\n\n              Fortunately, Web servers can indicate to the browser that certain documents do not require cross-origin protection. This mechanism to selectively disable that protection is called Cross-Origin Resource Sharing or CORS [FETCH]. By responding to browser requests with a specific combination of HTTP headers, servers can indicate which actions are allowed for a given resource. For Solid, the goal is to allow all actions on the CORS level, such that the deeper Authorization layer can exert full control over the app\u2019s allowed permissions. The next section describes how to achieve this through the right HTTP header configuration.\n\n              \n                CORS Server\n                \n                  A server MUST implement the CORS protocol [FETCH] such that, to the extent possible, the browser allows Solid apps to send any request and combination of request headers to the server, and the Solid app can read any response and response headers received from the server.

It is modelled after the Accept-Patch header defined in [RFC5789] and the Accept-Post header defined in [LDP].\n\n                      The syntax for Accept-Put, using the ABNF syntax defined in Section 1.2 of [RFC7231], is:\n\n                      Accept-Put = \"Accept-Put\" \":\" # media-range\n\n                      The Accept-Put header specifies a comma-separated list of media ranges (with optional parameters) as defined by [RFC7231], Section 5.3.2. The Accept-Put header, in effect, uses the same syntax as the HTTP Accept header minus the optional accept-params BNF production, since the latter does not apply to Accept-Put.\n\n                      The presence of the Accept-Put header in response to any method is an implicit indication that PUT is allowed on the resource identified by the request URI. The presence of a specific document format in this header indicates that that specific format is allowed on PUT requests to the resource identified by the request URI.\n\n                      IANA Registration Template:\n\n                      The Accept-Put response header must be added to the permanent registry (see [RFC3864]).\n\n                     \n                      Header field name\n                      Accept-Put\n                      Applicable Protocol\n                      HTTP\n                      Author/Change controller\n                      W3C Solid Community Group\n                      Specification document\n                      This specification\n                     \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            "^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> .

<file:///var/www/specification/protocol.html#security-considerations> <http://schema.org/description> "\n                  This section is non-normative.\n\n                  While this section attempts to highlight a set of security considerations, it is not a complete list. Implementers are urged to seek the advice of security professionals when implementing mission critical systems using the technology outlined in this specification.\n\n                  Implementations are subject to the same security considerations that are found in HTTP/1.1 [RFC7230] and [RFC7231].\n\n                  Servers are strongly discouraged from assuming that HTTP request headers\u2019 field-values are valid or non-malicious. Servers are strongly encouraged to sanitize requests before processing them or incorporating them in messages sent to others. Servers are encouraged to reject bad requests that conflict with this specification's normative requirements. Servers are encouraged to apply normalization and canonicalization algorithms where applicable. Servers are encouraged to take measures to mitigate potential timing attacks attempting to discover resource existence even if requesting agent has no access to the resource(s). Servers are strongly discouraged from exposing information beyond the minimum amount necessary to enable a feature.\n\n                  Servers are strongly discouraged from assuming that the user agent is a regular Web browser, even when requests contain familiar values in headers such as User-Agent or Origin. Such an assumption could lead to incorrect conclusions about the security model of the application making the request, since the request might actually come from a non-browser actor unaffected by browser security constraints.\n\n                  Servers disable all cross-origin protections in browsers because resource access is governed explicitly by the Authorization component. As such, servers cannot rely on browser-based cross-origin protection mechanisms for determining the authentication status or representation of a resource. In particular, servers are strongly encouraged to ignore HTTP cookies from untrusted origins. Additional security measures can be taken to prevent metadata in error responses from leaking. For instance, a malicious application could probe multiple servers to check whether the response status code is 401 or 403, or could try to access an error page from an intranet server within the user agent\u2019s private network to extract company names or other data. To mitigate this, when a request from an untrusted Origin arrives, the server may want to set the status code of error responses to 404 and/or anonymize or censor their contents.\n\n                  Servers are encouraged to use TLS connections to protect the contents of requests and responses from eavesdropping and modification by third parties. Unsecured TCP connections without TLS may be used in testing environments or when the server is behind a reverse proxy that terminates a secure connection.\n                "^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> .

Our aim is to have inclusive designs for wide range of people and their abilities. This section details general accessibility considerations to take into account for Web content accessibility, accessible applications, authoring tools, and accessible user agents that uses this specification.\n\n                  Web Content Accessibility: As with implementation of any Web standard or protocol, ignoring accessibility issues makes information unusable by a large subset of the population. It is strongly encouraged to follow accessibility guidelines and standards, such as the W3C Accessibility Guidelines [WCAG-3.0] to cover an array of recommendations to make content accessible to a wider range of people regardless of any disability, limitation, or sensitivity. It is also strongly encouraged to follow the guidance of Making content usable for people with cognitive and learning disabilities [COGA-USABLE].\n\n                  Accessible Applications: To help assistive technologies to provide a consistent user interface and understanding of the objects, it is strongly encouraged to follow the Accessible Rich Internet Applications [WAI-ARIA-1.2] recommendations. To enable semantic navigation, styling and interactive features in context of digital publishing, it is encouraged to follow the Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA Module 1.0 [DPUB-ARIA-1.0]. To support structured graphics such as charts, graphs, technical drawings and scientific diagrams, to assistive technologies in order improve accessibility of graphics or diagrams through detailed annotations, it is encouraged to follow the WAI-ARIA Graphics Module [GRAPHICS-ARIA-1.0].\n\n                  Authoring Tool Accessibility: To contribute to the proliferation of Web content that is accessible to a broad range of people, it is strongly encouraged to follow the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines [ATAG20] in the design of authoring tools to support the production of accessible content through accessible user interfaces.\n\n                  User Agent Accessibility Guidelines: To support the general principles for the development of accessible user agents, i.e., any software that retrieves, renders and facilitates end-user interaction with web content, it is strongly encouraged to follow the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines [UAAG20].\n                "^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> .

<file:///var/www/specification/protocol.html#considerations> <http://schema.org/description> "\n              This section details security, privacy, accessibility and internationalization considerations.\n\n              Some of the normative references with this specification point to documents with a Living Standard or Draft status, meaning their contents can still change over time. It is advised to monitor these documents, as such changes might have implications.\n\n              \n                Security Considerations\n                \n                  This section is non-normative.\n\n                  While this section attempts to highlight a set of security considerations, it is not a complete list. Implementers are urged to seek the advice of security professionals when implementing mission critical systems using the technology outlined in this specification.\n\n                  Implementations are subject to the same security considerations that are found in HTTP/1.1 [RFC7230] and [RFC7231].\n\n                  Servers are strongly discouraged from assuming that HTTP request headers\u2019 field-values are valid or non-malicious. Servers are strongly encouraged to sanitize requests before processing them or incorporating them in messages sent to others. Servers are encouraged to reject bad requests that conflict with this specification's normative requirements. Servers are encouraged to apply normalization and canonicalization algorithms where applicable. Servers are encouraged to take measures to mitigate potential timing attacks attempting to discover resource existence even if requesting agent has no access to the resource(s). Servers are strongly discouraged from exposing information beyond the minimum amount necessary to enable a feature.\n\n                  Servers are strongly discouraged from assuming that the user agent is a regular Web browser, even when requests contain familiar values in headers such as User-Agent or Origin. Such an assumption could lead to incorrect conclusions about the security model of the application making the request, since the request might actually come from a non-browser actor unaffected by browser security constraints.\n\n                  Servers disable all cross-origin protections in browsers because resource access is governed explicitly by the Authorization component. As such, servers cannot rely on browser-based cross-origin protection mechanisms for determining the authentication status or representation of a resource. In particular, servers are strongly encouraged to ignore HTTP cookies from untrusted origins. Additional security measures can be taken to prevent metadata in error responses from leaking. For instance, a malicious application could probe multiple servers to check whether the response status code is 401 or 403, or could try to access an error page from an intranet server within the user agent\u2019s private network to extract company names or other data. To mitigate this, when a request from an untrusted Origin arrives, the server may want to set the status code of error responses to 404 and/or anonymize or censor their contents.\n\n                  Servers are encouraged to use TLS connections to protect the contents of requests and responses from eavesdropping and modification by third parties.

Our aim is to have inclusive designs for wide range of people and their abilities. This section details general accessibility considerations to take into account for Web content accessibility, accessible applications, authoring tools, and accessible user agents that uses this specification.\n\n                  Web Content Accessibility: As with implementation of any Web standard or protocol, ignoring accessibility issues makes information unusable by a large subset of the population. It is strongly encouraged to follow accessibility guidelines and standards, such as the W3C Accessibility Guidelines [WCAG-3.0] to cover an array of recommendations to make content accessible to a wider range of people regardless of any disability, limitation, or sensitivity. It is also strongly encouraged to follow the guidance of Making content usable for people with cognitive and learning disabilities [COGA-USABLE].\n\n                  Accessible Applications: To help assistive technologies to provide a consistent user interface and understanding of the objects, it is strongly encouraged to follow the Accessible Rich Internet Applications [WAI-ARIA-1.2] recommendations. To enable semantic navigation, styling and interactive features in context of digital publishing, it is encouraged to follow the Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA Module 1.0 [DPUB-ARIA-1.0]. To support structured graphics such as charts, graphs, technical drawings and scientific diagrams, to assistive technologies in order improve accessibility of graphics or diagrams through detailed annotations, it is encouraged to follow the WAI-ARIA Graphics Module [GRAPHICS-ARIA-1.0].\n\n                  Authoring Tool Accessibility: To contribute to the proliferation of Web content that is accessible to a broad range of people, it is strongly encouraged to follow the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines [ATAG20] in the design of authoring tools to support the production of accessible content through accessible user interfaces.\n\n                  User Agent Accessibility Guidelines: To support the general principles for the development of accessible user agents, i.e., any software that retrieves, renders and facilitates end-user interaction with web content, it is strongly encouraged to follow the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines [UAAG20].\n                \n              \n\n              \n                Internationalization Considerations\n                \n                  This section is non-normative.\n\n                  Adaptability of content and software to the needs of target audiences helps towards accessibility. The mechanisms to cater information and interfaces so that people from any culture, region, or language preference can participate better. Towards this end, it is strongly encouraged to apply the recommendations and best practices of W3C Internationalization Activity. For example, content authors can:\n\n                  \n                    include links to navigate to different languages of the content;\n                    declare the base language of a document, indicate multiple languages and their directional flow \u2013 to help with translations;\n                    use Unicode character encoding, e.g., UTF-8, in data forms and text to ensure correct effects;\n                    check and minimise inappropriate cultural bias, and improve translatability;\n                    restrict markup use to structure and semantics.\n                  \n                \n              \n\n              \n                Security and Privacy Review\n                \n                  This section is non-normative.\n\n                  These questions provide an overview of security and privacy considerations for this specification as guided by [SECURITY-PRIVACY-QUESTIONNAIRE].\n\n                  \n                    What information might this feature expose to Web sites or other parties, and for what purposes is that exposure necessary?\n                    ..\n\n                    Do features in your specification expose the minimum amount of information necessary to enable their intended uses?\n                    ..\n\n                    How do the features in your specification deal with personal information, personally-identifiable information (PII), or information derived from them?\n                    ..\n\n                    How do the features in your specification deal with sensitive information?\n                    ..\n\n                    Do the features in your specification introduce new state for an origin that persists across browsing sessions?\n                    ..\n\n                    Do the features in your specification expose information about the underlying platform to origins?\n                    ..\n\n                    Does this specification allow an origin to send data to the underlying platform?\n                    ..\n\n                    Do features in this specification allow an origin access to sensors on a user\u2019s device?\n                    ..\n\n                    What data do the features in this specification expose to an origin?

Solid adds to existing Web standards to realise a space where individuals can maintain their autonomy, control their data and privacy, and choose applications and services to fulfil their needs.\n\n              The Solid ecosystem encapsulates a set of specifications that are guided by the principles we have adopted and also the priority of our values. We acknowledge that every technical decision has ethical implications both for the end user (short-term) as well as society (long-term). To contribute towards a net positive social benefit, we use the Ethical Web Principles to orient ourselves. The consensus on the technical designs are informed by common use cases, implementation experience, and use.\n\n              An overarching design goal of the Solid ecosystem is to be evolvable and to provide fundamental affordances for decentralised Web applications for information exchange in a way that is secure and privacy respecting. In this environment, actors allocate identifiers for their content, shape and store data where they have access to, set access control policies, and use preferred applications and services to achieve them.\n\n              The general architectural principles of Solid specifications are borrowed from the Architecture of the World Wide Web. The components as described in each specification may evolve independently \u2013 according to the principle of orthogonality in order to increase the flexibility and robustness of the Solid ecosystem. With that, the specifications are loosely coupled and indicate which features overlap with those governed by another specification. Extensibility as well as variability also are taken into account in each specification.\n\n              The specifications in the ecosystem describe how Solid servers and clients can be interoperable by using Web communication protocols, global identifiers, authentication and authorization mechanisms, data formats and shapes, and query interfaces.\n\n              The specifications are accompanied with supplemental documents, such as Primers and Best Practices and Guidelines to help implementers to form a well-rounded understanding of the Solid ecosystem as well as ways to improve their implementations.\n\n              This specification is for:\n\n              \n                Resource server developers that want to enable clients to send and retrieve information;\n                Application developers that want to implement a client to perform operations on resources.\n              \n\n              \n                Terminology\n                \n                  This section is non-normative.\n\n                  The Solid Protocol specification defines the following terms. These terms are referenced throughout this specification.\n\n                  \n\n                  \n                    data pod\n                    A data pod is a place for storing documents, with mechanisms for controlling who can access what.\n\n                    Solid app\n                    A Solid app is an application that reads or writes data from one or more storages.\n\n                    URI\n                    A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) provides the means for identifying resources [RFC3986].\n\n                    resource\n                    A resource is the target of an HTTP request identified by a URI [RFC7231].\n\n                    container resource\n                    A container resource is a hierarchical collection of resources that contains other resources, including containers.\n\n                    root container\n                    A root container is a container resource that is at the highest level of the collection hierarchy.\n\n                    resource metadata\n                    Resource metadata encompasses data about resources described by means of RDF statements [RDF11-CONCEPTS].\n\n                    agent\n                    An agent is a person, social entity, or software identified by a URI; e.g., a WebID denotes an agent [WEBID].\n\n                    owner\n                    An owner is a person or a social entity that is considered to have the rights and responsibilities of a data storage. An owner is identified by a URI, and implicitly has control over all data in a storage. An owner is first set at storage provisioning time and can be changed.\n\n                    origin\n                    An origin indicates where an HTTP request originates from [RFC6454].\n\n                    read operation\n                    A read operation entails that information about a resource\u2019s existence or its description can be known. [Source]\n\n                    write operation\n                    A write operation entails that information about resources can be created or removed. [Source]\n\n                    append operation\n                    An append operation entails that information can be added but not removed.

[Source]. It follows that all resources are discoverable from a container and that it is not possible to create orphan resources. [Source]\n\n                  The representation and behaviour of containers in Solid corresponds to LDP Basic Container and MUST be supported by server. [Source]\n\n                  Servers can determine the value of the HTTP Last-Modified header field in response to HEAD and GET requests targeting a container based on changes to containment triples.\n\n                  \n                    Note: Container Last-Modified Comparison\n                    \n                      The Last-Modified of a container will not change when other parts of the container changes. This is to avoid instant propagation of changes all the way to the root container. As Last-Modified cannot be reliably used to check whether the container representation has changed in any way.

When not present, they are presumed to be the empty formula {}.\n                    \n\n                    While other specifications might provide a structure and interpretation for a wider class of N3 Patch documents, the present specification only governs the application of N3 Patch documents that additionally adhere to the following constraints:\n\n                    \n                      The patch document MUST contain exactly one patch resource, identified by one or more of the triple patterns described above, which all share the same ?patch subject.\n                      A patch resource MUST contain a triple ?patch rdf:type solid:InsertDeletePatch.\n                      The ?insertions and ?deletions formulae MUST NOT contain variables that do not occur in the ?conditions formula.\n                      The ?insertions and ?deletions formulae MUST NOT contain blank nodes.\n                    \n\n                    Servers MUST respond with a 422 status code [RFC4918] if a patch document does not satisfy all of the above constraints.\n\n                    When ?conditions is non-empty, servers MUST treat the request as a Read operation. When ?insertions is non-empty, servers MUST (also) treat the request as an Append operation. When ?deletions is non-empty, servers MUST treat the request as a Read and Write operation.\n\n                    Servers MUST process a patch resource against the target document as follows:\n\n                    \n                      Start from the RDF dataset in the target document, or an empty RDF dataset if the target resource does not exist yet.\n                      If ?conditions is non-empty, find all (possibly empty) variable mappings such that all of the resulting triples occur in the dataset.\n                      If no such mapping exists, or if multiple mappings exist, the server MUST respond with a 409 status code. [Source]\n                      The resulting variable mapping is propagated to the ?deletions and ?insertions formulae to obtain two sets of resulting triples.\n                      If the set of triples resulting from ?deletions is non-empty and the dataset does not contain all of these triples, the server MUST respond with a 409 status code. [Source]\n                      The triples resulting from ?deletions are to be removed from the RDF dataset.\n                      The triples resulting from ?insertions are to be added to the RDF dataset, with each blank node from ?insertions resulting in a newly created blank node.\n                      The combination of deletions followed by insertions then forms the new resource state of the RDF document, and the server responds with the appropriate status code.\n                    \n                  \n\n                  \n                    Example: Applying an N3 patch.\n                    @prefix solid: <http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/terms#>.\n@prefix ex: <http://www.example.org/terms#>.\n\n_:rename a solid:InsertDeletePatch;\n  solid:where   { ?person ex:familyName \"Garcia\". };\n  solid:inserts { ?person ex:givenName \"Alex\". };\n  solid:deletes { ?person ex:givenName \"Claudia\". }.\n                    This N3 Patch instructs to rename Claudia Garcia into Alex Garcia, on the condition that no other Garcia family members are present in the target RDF document.\n                  \n                \n              \n\n              \n                Deleting Resources\n                \n                  Servers MUST support the HTTP DELETE method [RFC7231]. [Source] [Source]\n\n                  When a DELETE request targets storage\u2019s root container or its associated ACL resource, the server MUST respond with the 405 status code. Server MUST exclude the DELETE method in the HTTP response header Allow in response to requests to these resources [RFC7231]. [Source]\n\n                  When a contained resource is deleted, the server MUST also remove the corresponding containment triple. [Source]\n\n                  When a contained resource is deleted, the server MUST also delete the associated auxiliary resources (see the Auxiliary Resources section).\n\n                  When a DELETE request targets a container, the server MUST delete the container if it contains no resources. If the container contains resources, the server MUST respond with the 409 status code and response body describing the error. [Source]\n\n                  This section is non-normative.\n\n                  The server might perform additional actions, as described in the normative references like [RFC7231]. For example, the server could remove membership triples referring to the deleted resource, perform additional cleanup tasks for resources it knows are no longer referenced or have not been accessed for some period of time, and so on.\n\n                  Subsequent GET requests to the deleted resource usually result in a 404 or 410 status code, although HTTP allows others.

That draft does not include an authentication mechanism, and therefore the Protocol will transition to a new design. The new design is currently at Solid Notifications Protocol [SOLID-NOTIFICATIONS-PROTOCOL]. It is planned to include both security through authentication, and also common formats with other forms of real-time notification in the Solid ecosystem.\n\n                  Both client and server implementations should provide the existing protocol, and should transition to providing both protocols as the new one becomes available..\n\n                  The future directions of the protocol include moving from a simple one-bit notification that a resource has changed, requiring the client to reload the resource, to adding PATCH information in the notification so the client can calculate the new state immediately.\n                \n              \n            \n          \n\n          \n            Cross-Origin Resource Sharing\n            \n              Solid apps typically access data from multiple sources. However, Web browsers by default prevent apps that run on one origin from accessing data on other origins. This cross-origin protection is a security mechanism that ensures malicious websites cannot simply read your profile or banking details from other websites. However, this reasonable default poses a problem even for benevolent Solid apps, which might have good reasons to access data from different places. For instance, a Solid app at https://app.example/ would be prevented from accessing data on https://guinan.example/ or https://darmok.example/, even when Guinan and Darmok have given the user of the app their permission to see some of their data.\n\n              For cases where the other origins have their own access protection mechanism \u2014 like within Solid \u2014 the browser\u2019s built-in cross-origin protection is actually an obstacle rather than a feature. After all, storages already ensure through access control that certain documents can only be accessed by specific people or applications. Preventively blocking apps from different origins thus introduces an unnecessary barrier.\n\n              Fortunately, Web servers can indicate to the browser that certain documents do not require cross-origin protection. This mechanism to selectively disable that protection is called Cross-Origin Resource Sharing or CORS [FETCH]. By responding to browser requests with a specific combination of HTTP headers, servers can indicate which actions are allowed for a given resource. For Solid, the goal is to allow all actions on the CORS level, such that the deeper Authorization layer can exert full control over the app\u2019s allowed permissions. The next section describes how to achieve this through the right HTTP header configuration.\n\n              \n                CORS Server\n                \n                  A server MUST implement the CORS protocol [FETCH] such that, to the extent possible, the browser allows Solid apps to send any request and combination of request headers to the server, and the Solid app can read any response and response headers received from the server. If the server wishes to block access to a resource, this MUST NOT happen via CORS but MUST instead be communicated to the Solid app in the browser through HTTP status codes such as 401, 403, or 404 [RFC7231].\n\n                  \n                    Note: CORS Protocol Blocking\n                    \n                      Since the CORS protocol is part of a Living Standard, it might be changed at any point, which might necessitate changes to server implementations for continued prevention of undesired blocking. A proposal to mitigate this has been suggested.\n                    \n                  \n\n                  Concretely, whenever a server receives an HTTP request containing a valid Origin header [RFC6454], the server MUST respond with the appropriate Access-Control-* headers as specified in the CORS protocol [FETCH]. In particular, the server MUST set the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to the valid Origin value from the request and list Origin in the Vary header value. The server MUST make all used response headers readable for the Solid app through Access-Control-Expose-Headers (with the possible exception of the Access-Control-* headers themselves). A server MUST also support the HTTP OPTIONS method [RFC7231] such that it can respond appropriately to CORS preflight requests.\n\n                  Careful attention is warranted, especially because of the many edge cases. For instance, server SHOULD explicitly enumerate all used response headers under Access-Control-Expose-Headers rather than resorting to *, which does not cover all cases (such as credentials mode set to include). Servers SHOULD also explicitly list Accept under Access-Control-Allow-Headers, because values longer than 128 characters (not uncommon for RDF-based Solid apps) would otherwise be blocked, despite shorter Accept headers being allowed without explicit mention.\n                \n              \n            \n          \n\n          \n            Identity\n            \n              \n                WebID\n                \n                  A WebID is an HTTP URI denoting an agent, for example a person, organisation, or software [WEBID]. When a WebID is dereferenced, server provides a representation of the WebID Profile in an RDF document [RDF11-CONCEPTS] which uniquely describes an agent denoted by a WebID. WebIDs are an underpinning component in the Solid ecosystem and are used as the primary identifier for users and applications.\n                \n              \n            \n          \n\n          \n            Authentication\n            \n              \n                Solid-OIDC\n                \n                  The Solid OpenID Connect (Solid OIDC) specification defines how resource servers verify the identity of relying parties and end users based on the authentication performed by an OpenID provider [SOLID-OIDC].\n                \n              \n\n              \n                WebID-TLS\n                \n                  This section is non-normative.\n\n                  The Solid ecosystem initially relied on WebID-TLS for authenticated resource access [WEBID-TLS]. The current recommendation for authentication relies on Solid-OIDC (Solid-OIDC). Implementations can use WebID-TLS just as any other mechanism as an additional authentication method.\n                \n              \n            \n          \n\n\n          \n            Authorization\n            \n              \n                Web Access Control\n                \n                  Web Access Control (WAC) is a decentralized cross-domain access control system providing a way for Linked Data systems to set authorization conditions on HTTP resources using the Access Control List (ACL) model. Server manages the association between a resource and an ACL resource, and applies the authorization conditions on requested operations. Authorizations are described using the ACL ontology to express and determine access privileges of a requested resource. Applications can discover authorization rules associated with a given resource, and to control such rules, as directed by an agent.\n\n                  Servers MUST conform to the Web Access Control specification [WAC].\n\n                  Clients MUST conform to the Web Access Control specification [WAC].\n\n                  [Source] [Source] Source] Source]\n                \n              \n            \n          \n\n          \n            HTTP Definitions\n            \n              \n                HTTP Headers\n                \n                  \n                    The Accept-Put Response Header\n                    \n                      This specification introduces a new HTTP response header Accept-Put used to specify the document formats accepted by the server on HTTP PUT requests. It is modelled after the Accept-Patch header defined in [RFC5789] and the Accept-Post header defined in [LDP].\n\n                      The syntax for Accept-Put, using the ABNF syntax defined in Section 1.2 of [RFC7231], is:\n\n                      Accept-Put = \"Accept-Put\" \":\" # media-range\n\n                      The Accept-Put header specifies a comma-separated list of media ranges (with optional parameters) as defined by [RFC7231], Section 5.3.2. The Accept-Put header, in effect, uses the same syntax as the HTTP Accept header minus the optional accept-params BNF production, since the latter does not apply to Accept-Put.\n\n                      The presence of the Accept-Put header in response to any method is an implicit indication that PUT is allowed on the resource identified by the request URI. The presence of a specific document format in this header indicates that that specific format is allowed on PUT requests to the resource identified by the request URI.\n\n                      IANA Registration Template:\n\n                      The Accept-Put response header must be added to the permanent registry (see [RFC3864]).\n\n                     \n                      Header field name\n                      Accept-Put\n                      Applicable Protocol\n                      HTTP\n                      Author/Change controller\n                      W3C Solid Community Group\n                      Specification document\n                      This specification\n                     \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n\n          \n            Considerations\n            \n              This section details security, privacy, accessibility and internationalization considerations.\n\n              Some of the normative references with this specification point to documents with a Living Standard or Draft status, meaning their contents can still change over time. It is advised to monitor these documents, as such changes might have implications.\n\n              \n                Security Considerations\n                \n                  This section is non-normative.\n\n                  While this section attempts to highlight a set of security considerations, it is not a complete list. Implementers are urged to seek the advice of security professionals when implementing mission critical systems using the technology outlined in this specification.\n\n                  Implementations are subject to the same security considerations that are found in HTTP/1.1 [RFC7230] and [RFC7231].\n\n                  Servers are strongly discouraged from assuming that HTTP request headers\u2019 field-values are valid or non-malicious. Servers are strongly encouraged to sanitize requests before processing them or incorporating them in messages sent to others. Servers are encouraged to reject bad requests that conflict with this specification's normative requirements. Servers are encouraged to apply normalization and canonicalization algorithms where applicable. Servers are encouraged to take measures to mitigate potential timing attacks attempting to discover resource existence even if requesting agent has no access to the resource(s). Servers are strongly discouraged from exposing information beyond the minimum amount necessary to enable a feature.\n\n                  Servers are strongly discouraged from assuming that the user agent is a regular Web browser, even when requests contain familiar values in headers such as User-Agent or Origin. Such an assumption could lead to incorrect conclusions about the security model of the application making the request, since the request might actually come from a non-browser actor unaffected by browser security constraints.\n\n                  Servers disable all cross-origin protections in browsers because resource access is governed explicitly by the Authorization component. As such, servers cannot rely on browser-based cross-origin protection mechanisms for determining the authentication status or representation of a resource. In particular, servers are strongly encouraged to ignore HTTP cookies from untrusted origins. Additional security measures can be taken to prevent metadata in error responses from leaking. For instance, a malicious application could probe multiple servers to check whether the response status code is 401 or 403, or could try to access an error page from an intranet server within the user agent\u2019s private network to extract company names or other data. To mitigate this, when a request from an untrusted Origin arrives, the server may want to set the status code of error responses to 404 and/or anonymize or censor their contents.\n\n                  Servers are encouraged to use TLS connections to protect the contents of requests and responses from eavesdropping and modification by third parties. Unsecured TCP connections without TLS may be used in testing environments or when the server is behind a reverse proxy that terminates a secure connection.\n                \n              \n\n              \n                Privacy Considerations\n                \n                  This section is non-normative.\n\n                  Servers are encouraged to use authorization techniques to prevent unwanted access to resources, rather than depending on the relative obscurity of their resource names.\n\n                  \n                    Identifiable Information\n                    \n                      In order to prevent leakage of non-resource data, servers are strongly discouraged from including identifiable information in error responses.\n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n\n              \n                Accessibility Considerations\n                \n                  This section is non-normative.\n\n                  We acknowledge the diversity of people using the Web, anyone that may create or use information. Our aim is to have inclusive designs for wide range of people and their abilities. This section details general accessibility considerations to take into account for Web content accessibility, accessible applications, authoring tools, and accessible user agents that uses this specification.\n\n                  Web Content Accessibility: As with implementation of any Web standard or protocol, ignoring accessibility issues makes information unusable by a large subset of the population. It is strongly encouraged to follow accessibility guidelines and standards, such as the W3C Accessibility Guidelines [WCAG-3.0] to cover an array of recommendations to make content accessible to a wider range of people regardless of any disability, limitation, or sensitivity.
