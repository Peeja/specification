### WIP Implementation Feedback

* VB: We'll allocate some time for implementation feedback or interest to implement. Links to products/projects and demos welcome.

#### Demo

Proposed by: Fred Gibson

* FG: Enabling information interoperability by thinking of a pod as the complete space-time model for a part of the world where the pod has two interconnecting hierarchies, a hierarchy of files/documents in ldp containers with root at /, and a hierarchy of system relations with root at the webid for the system that the pod represents.  A demo of this approach in action using a Car Dealership building on a TrinPod.
