## Feedback Sessions

### Meeting Format
Time: 2 Minutes
Speaking: Justin B

Goals: 

* Learn which features or issues are high / low priority, and where applicable, adjust timelines or editorial priorities. This could impact the order in which features are integrated into Solid specifications
* Surface, discuss, and track open questions or concerns
* Learn the best way to structure subsequent sessions, and other mechanisms for feedback (e.g. surveys)

Each implementer on the Agenda will have at least 4 minutes to speak uninterrupted, and (approximately) one minute for clarifying questions from editors. Time can be ceded to others if all is not needed. Clarifying questions should be queued for efficiency, and may be taken offline due to time constraints.
