## Topics

### Solid Protocol Publication and Access
* SC: Pinged Solid Team about the proposal in  https://github.com/solid/specification/blob/main/meetings/2021-12-22.md#solid-protocol-publication-and-access . Should be in the next Team agenda.
* JB: Asked CSS team on recommending that. Running CSS behind nginx. Vanilla config should get us most of the way there. Where to put it? Most likely use the same hosting strategy for solidproject.org as solidcommunity.net. Will ping current Admins - needs to be a group project. I can collaborate with them - a go to people. Can set up hosting for it. Setup a stage environment to test different publishing strategies. What kind of control over the URI space etc.
* KK: Came to the conclusion when updating the specs. Needs to be a high priority. How to do certain merges and releases. Protocol for publishing :)
* JB: Agree. Need stable and automated way. Conversely really awesome when it works.


### Milestone 0.9.x
URL: https://github.com/solid/specification/milestone/6

* KK: There are some there. We haven't sized or prioritised. Just put stuff in there.. then we go and release.
* SC: Issues or PRs tagged for revisit can be put into this milestone right?
* KK: Right.
* KK: JB, I created https://github.com/solid/specification/issues/370 . Assign to you?
* JB: Yes.
* KK: Publishing to a Solid server is what we'd want to do.
* JB: GH pages make it easy for specific subset. Outside of that you're on your own. We can automate with actions.
* SC: ..
* KK: If we edit, and want to do something. We'll dump the patch version.
* SC: Use github actions and solid server together.. read-only or read-write server?
* KK: read-write for github action.
* SC: ..
* JB: There are options e.g node-client. Just need to auth. We can make it so that it triggers automatically e.g on merge to main. There is flexibility.
* SC: Can have writes to URL and flow back into git repo. There are node modules that can create commits and push on resource change. Can't remember the name - tested with dokieli writes against NSS. inotifywait?


### Solid Ecosystem
URL: https://solidproject.org/TR/ecosystem

* SC: Intended to communicate how the specifications in the ecosystem come together. But currently only includes a copy of `/TR/protocol#introduction` to emphasise the general vision, ethical considerations, and web architecture.
* `/TR/` (Index of Technical Reports) includes Work Items in context of the Solid CG.
* SC: If we keep `/TR/ecosystem`, it should talk or refer to the vision of the Solid project.
* KK: Keep /TR/?
* SC: Useful. Like W3C's /TR/
* JB: /TR/ is useful.
* KK: There are issues tagged with ecosystem. Things that need to be explained without normative text.
* JB: There is more that can go in there. /ecosystem would be like the primer.
* SC: Cool.


### Versioning and Publication of Work Items
* SC: ...
* KK: Fine with /ED/ /TR/ alongside /TR/{yyyy}/
