## Topics


The following is a list of Solid Roadmap Milestones, force-ranked in priority order (*note: still pending review)*.

### Solid Notifications Protocol and WebSocketSubscription Type
* SC: Reference in the next publication of /TR/protocol e.g., 0.9.1.
* SC: Pending review/acceptance of PRs on solid/specification PRs: https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/391 , https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/392
* SC: I'll abstain from reviewing at least 391 (as I'm one of the editors). May do minor reviewing of 392 but I've indirectly approved this as per notifications-panel/chairing..
* KK: I will review as soon as possible.KK
* JB: Consider proposals to add normative language to the [Solid Protocol Specification](https://solidproject.org/TR/protocol) that requires support for the [WebSocketSubscription2021](https://solid.github.io/notifications/protocol#websocketsubscription2021) subscription type as specified by the [Solid Notifications Protocol](https://solid.github.io/notifications/protocol).
* JB: Target for next publication.
* JB: Will review both PRs.


### Solid OIDC and Solid OIDC Primer
* SC: PR https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/386
* SC: Will submit review this week.
* SC: Should be referenced in 0.9.1.
* KK: I have started reviewing.
* JB: Will submit review by next week (maybe sooner, but cannot commit to sooner)
* KK: Too many ping-pongs. I'd like to see how that can be simplified. Some terms on authn/z needs to be clarified.
* SC: How deep are we reviewing the technical decisions in these specs? We need to be consistent on how we evaluate.
* JB: Will look at how information is presented in order to support implementaiton / authz server. What does authorization-server entail? It came towards near the end of the process. Was it jammed in or is there enough context for everyone?
* KK: We can't stop from publishing. Not our role. But it also needs bigger picture of things. Useful to get feedback from others. I'd challenge them on the simplifications and notions on the complexity.
* SC: If it generally fits the big picture / scope, it is acknowledged as a work item. This is proposed as ~FPWD.



## Authorization by Client Identifier

* JB: Consider proposals to add normative language to the [Solid Protocol Specification](https://solidproject.org/TR/protocol) that requires any supported access control system (e.g. WAC, ACP) to enable or restrict access by a client application identifier.
* SC: WAC will have acl:client (as per prior meeting/agreement).
* JB: Make sure Authorization section mentions agent and client as MUST.
* SC: This is approaching authorization with identity/actor-centric access control. Is that the only approach we are taking? https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/issues/121 is broad view.
* KK: Is it replacing same-origin?
* SC: Orthogonal
* JB: Origin only plugged for a specific case.
* SC: Auth making use of Origin header is about the warning from the browser. SOP has been a cornerstore of Web security.
* SC: Currently requiring client_id for Authorization would tie or expect it to work with something like Solid OIDC. If we are decoupling these components, does that still make sense?
* JB: The system provides the credentials for client - need to be able to.
* SC: If a new authn doesn't provide client, what would it mean for authz? e.g., capability
* JB: Saying support for client ids need not exclude non-client id..
* SC: 0.9.1ish



### Storage Description and Capability Discovery
* SC: https://github.com/solid/specification/issues/355
* JB: Ack.
* KK: Ack.
* SC: 0.9.1 or 0.9.2?


### Server Description and Capability Discovery
* SC: https://github.com/solid/specification/issues/355 - started off with server but seems like storage is the only one with a resource.
* SC: Storage provisioning: https://github.com/solid/specification/issues/317
* JB: How a client may determine capabilities and/or features offered by a given Solid server. For example, if a server supports additional notification types beyond WebSocketSubscription2021, or server-side validation by a given mechanism.
* JB: Standardise API for storages and
* KK: My main concern is that a server administrator should not override the storage's management of its own scope.
* SC: How about creating identities.. falls on Solid OIDC?
* JB: Yes. Keep separate.
* SC: Would Solid Protocol refer to Solid OIDC for IdP etc.
* JB: Server could say issuers they trust.. 
* SC: 0.9.2 or closer to 1.0?



### Additional Notification Types

* JB: Consider proposals to add normative language to the [Solid Protocol Specification](https://solidproject.org/TR/protocol) that add support for additional Notification Types detailed by the [Solid Notifications Protocol](https://solid.github.io/notifications/protocol), including but not limited to [EventSourceSubscription2021](https://solid.github.io/notifications/protocol#eventsourcesubscription2021), [LinkedDataNotificationSubscription2021](https://solid.github.io/notifications/protocol#linkeddatanotificationssubscription2021), and [WebHookSubscription2021](https://solid.github.io/notifications/protocol#webhooksubscription2021).
* SC: Solid Notifications Protocol will publish a separate document for subscription types. It is not required by Solid Notifications Protocol to implement any. So, up to Solid Protocol or other specs to require as they see fit which subscription types they need.
* SC: Need to check/compare their scopes to see where they're useful. WebSocket is for 'live updates'. LDN for client-server-server.
* JB: Solid can be valuable for different types of communications. 
* KK: Don't need to prioritise until there is more interaction with the community.


* SC: To be continued..
