## Topics

### Solid Control

* HS: Hi all. Just an update on what I am doing:
  I have a 1 year project from the EU to work on a project Solid Control based on 
     the [Launcher App](https://github.com/bblfish/LauncherApp) proposal I suggested a few years        ago in the Authentication panel. The idea  
* SC: There is an ACTION ([citation needed] in past minutes) on the Editors Team (for SC to propose) to have a community discussion on Authorization. And as you know the authn/z panels.
* SC: To find devs I think you should ping solid/chat and solid/app-development ?
* SC: Are you thinking about moving HTTPSig spec forward? How about CHAPI?
* TBL: What state is in?
* HS: Using IETF WG's RFC that's nearly finalised to signing HTTP headers and using that to authenticate.
* SC: It is a Draft now. What's next?
* HS: Yes, draft. Have implementation in Scala JS.. Java/Javascript. Spec from 5 months ago. Needs to be updated. The spec needs to be updated and update the server.
* TBL: How many other implementations of HTTPSig ar there?
* HS: HTTP Signature (or rather (httpbis-message-signature-11)[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures-11] is out there and has any implementations.
* SC: But what is the unique contribution that [HTTPSig](https://github.com/solid/authentication-panel/blob/main/proposals/HttpSignature.md) in context of Solid. I think right now that's the only consideration, not HTTP Signature in general.
* HS: HttpSig essentially just adds to the ietf RFC, the link to a WebID or KeyId. 
* HS: As part of [Solid-Control](https://github.com/co-operating-systems/solid-control) EU project I wrote an HTTP Signature in Scala [github httpSig implementation](https://github.com/bblfish/httpSig) (ready to be compiled for ScalaJS) making it easy for other solid pod implementations to allow authentication.
* SC: Suggestion: move spec forward, get more implementations (server or apps). Then we can look at if/where we can require. A bit early now. Right TBL, KK?
* TBL: Solid Pod should be open to ... authn is a function. ideally we have an api that swap in different things. allowing the user to select in real-time with a click. in a way we do for solid-oidc.. where they pick their IdP. We could also have log-in with HTTP Signature button.
* TBL: It is a good discipline. To have that flexibility point in the architecture.
* HS: ASambra had a protocol like that.. signing the headers. IETF is now closing in on HTTP Signature... so that can be used in Solid. We have it in/around since 2015.
* HS: It'll take time to get the milestones accepted.

### Actions from last Agenda Overview
URL: https://github.com/solid/specification/blob/main/meetings/2022-06-15.md#actions-from-last-agenda-overview

>ACTION: After resolving storage description, update ED to say MUST new/MAY old, SC.

* SC: TODO. Same as above re https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/409#issuecomment-1214977145

>ACTION: Publish 0.9.1 with that ED, SC.

* SC: TODO.

>ACTION: Update ED version. Include a change log for 0.9.1, SC.

* SC: 0.9.1 ED change log: https://solidproject.org/ED/protocol#change-log

ACTION: SC to add line about change/update re Websocket and Notification Protocol.

>ACTION: Reach out to solid-ui maintainers

* SC: TODO.

>ACTION: Ask in Solid/chat whether there are more WebSocket implementations.

* SC: TODO.



### Add WebID Profile as work item
URL: https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/413

* SC: Done.


### Add Test Suite Panel Charter. Update Panels
URL: https://github.com/solid/process/pull/288

* SC: Done.


### Add TR/2022/wac-20220705
URL: https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/417

* SC: What's next?
* SC: Version okay?
* KK: ..
* TBL: ..
* SC: Current `doap:revision` is `1.0.0`. So change to `1.0.0-CR.1`?
* KK: +1
* TBL: +1
* SC: Updated.
* KK: Approved
* TBL: +1'd.
* SC: We should separate revision code and human-readable version re "cr" == "Candidate Recommendation".
* KK: This is not really as unstable as a ED now, as CR it is less likely to change and implementers should implement it.

ACTION: KK, SC to follow with the suggestion.

ACTION: TBL to review.
