## Topics

### WIP Implementation Feedback
* SC: We'll allocate some time for implementation feedback or interest to implement. Links to products/projects and demos welcome.


### Add discovery and descriptions for implementation report, test suite, test case
URL: https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/542

* SC: Ongoing work on Solid QA. Please review.


### Update mission
URL: https://github.com/solid/solid-wg-charter/issues/7

* SC: This is editorial. PRs welcome.


### Add W3C Solid CG Charter
URL: https://github.com/solid/process/pull/323

* SC: We're not looking to make a decision now. This is primarily to build awareness and gather feedback.
* SC: Please review. This charter is for us.
* SC: Re: the timeline: https://github.com/solid/process/pull/323#issuecomment-1629875377 . Last call 2023-07-25. Accept/Merge after 2023-08-01.

#### License
* SC: See thread https://github.com/solid/process/pull/323#pullrequestreview-1512907580 discussing MIT and W3C CLA/FSA licenses.
* SC: Latest state of the discussion: whether the CG should only use W3C licenses or both MIT and W3C licenses.
* SC: AFAICT, W3C licenses are required for W3C CG DRAFT/FINAL docs. Other documents can be something else - as we've thus far with MIT. W3C snapshots can be created for particular versions.


#### Add Work Items section
URL: https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/543

* SC: The proposed CG charter includes a process for [new work item proposals](https://github.com/solid/process/blob/7a8cfc55edaaf9de26252976fa8365d7c884bdc7/solid-cg-charter.md#new-work-item-proposal) (NWIP).
* SC: As mentioned, "some of this information could be moved to other documents". So, this PR moves NWIP from proposed Charter to the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/solid/specification/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
* SC: Merging this PR should follow be followed with committing suggestion to refer to NWIP in Contributing Guide: https://github.com/solid/process/pull/323/files#r1267917483
* SC: There is some consensus on accepting the NWIP (based on reviews and feedback in the charter PR).
* SC: We'll look into further incorporating/updating [Solid Editorsâ€™ Technical Report Development Process](https://github.com/solid/process/blob/main/solid-editors-tr-process.md) in a separate thread. But for now:

PROPOSAL: Merge [PR](https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/543) and commit [suggestion in charter)[https://github.com/solid/process/pull/323/files#r1267917483].


### W3C Solid Business Group

* SC: '[Creating a "W3C Business Group"](https://github.com/solid/process/pull/323#issuecomment-1632996576)' was mentioned as a way to help frame the conversation / expectations" that go beyond CG's activities.
* SC: This is for general awareness and to continue the discussion. We don't need to make any particular decision in this call.


## Solid Demos
* SC: Background: Originally proposed back on 2021-08-05 at [Gitter/Matrix solid/app-development](https://matrix.to/#/!ogHmAuzhszmxlGQrVp:gitter.im/$FdBbaChBNThzgicpyNhs5eCPp07-Q1KCBrq8AqsTrio) . There is interest in the CG to conduct these series of events. It was welcomed by members of the Solid Editors Team: https://github.com/solid/specification/blob/main/meetings/2021-09-22.md#solid-demos .
* SC: Quoting for convenience/discussion:
  >@/all Who'd be interested in a regular "Solid Demos" gathering for the community to showcase their implementations (servers, apps..)? :)
  >Think along the lines of a demoscene ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene ) for Solid. It could be pretty useful to increase the visibility of implementations as well as to attract feedback from (developers, users, spec developers, ... investors?).
  >Quality of the work is not super important. Things don't have to be polished or production ready or whatever. Let's get ideas across and attract collaboration. Demos can be however long they need to be. 5 minutes? => awesome!


### Are uri semantics just neccessary or sufficient to determine containment relation?

### Proposals for Dedicated Calls
* [https://github.com/solid/specification/issues/525](Alternative solutions to container HATEOAS).
* Implementer Feedback.
* Solid Demos.
